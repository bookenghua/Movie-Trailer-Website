# Movie Trailer Website
[IPND] Stage 3: Create a Movie Website

In this stage, I wrote code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. The code, used in conjunction with the Python module, `fresh_tomatoes.py`, can be used to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer. In addition to the required code, I modified `fresh_tomatoes.py` to display the movie synopsis and movie release date.
